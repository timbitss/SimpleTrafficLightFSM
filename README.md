Simple Traffic Light FSM using TM4C123 MCU
======

I was able to receive great exposure to the **Tivaâ„¢ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller** via a MOOC called __Shape The World__, created by Dr. Jonathan Valvano and Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi.
Before this project, I had implemented finite state machines extensively in my digital systems courses at UBC, but in SystemVerilog rather than in C. This course taught me how to 
use structures in C to implement simple Moore FSMs which was pretty cool!
