Simple Traffic Light FSM using TM4C123 MCU
======

  I received great exposure to the **Tivaâ„¢ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller** via a MOOC called __Shape The World__, created by Dr. Jonathan Valvano and Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi, before working on this project. I had implemented finite state machines extensively in my digital systems courses at UBC, but in SystemVerilog rather than in C. This course taught me how to use C structures to implement simple Moore FSMs which was pretty cool! The live demo below will best explain the specifications for this project.
